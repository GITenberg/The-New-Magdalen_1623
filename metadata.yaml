description: Mercy, a nurse in the Franco-Prussian War, has her post taken over by
  the Germans. Mercy meets the emergency with great skill and aplomb, comforting the
  wounded soldiers and ensuring their safe passage. Her bravery is set in opposition
  to the cowardly surgeon and a timid English gentlewoman on her way to England to
  claim an inheritance from relatives who have never before met her.
